<h1><strong>Hi, I'm Danica Bijeljanin üëã</strong></h1>
<h3>Junior Software QA | Automation Engineer</h3>

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I'm a junior QA Engineer with a serious passion for finding and squashing bugs; while others run from them, I actively seek them out! üêû

I truly believe that curiosity, problem-solving, and a continuous drive for improvement are the keys to building high-quality software.

## About Me 
I've recently completed an intensive IT Bootcamp, where I gained a solid foundation in both manual and automation testing. I'm eager to dive into the world of software testing and contribute to the development of stable and reliable applications. My mission? To ensure everything runs smoothly and to deliver the best possible user experience! ‚ú®

## Projects I'm Proud Of ‚ù§Ô∏è

During my bootcamp, I worked on some exciting projects that helped me put my knowledge into practice:
* **SauceDemo UI Automation** [[GitHub]](https://github.com/etoile-venus/SaucedemoUIAutomation)
    * Developed automated UI tests using **Selenium WebDriver** and **TestNG** with a **Page Object Model** structure. Utilized **TestNG Data Provider** and a custom **ExcelReader** for managing test data from `.xlsx` files. Implemented both positive and negative test scenarios across various user profiles with soft and hard assertions. Test setup and teardown were managed using TestNG annotations.

* **Bookstore API Automation** [[GitHub]](https://github.com/etoile-venus/BookStoreApiAutomation)
    * Automated **CRUD** and authorization API tests using **Rest-Assured** and **TestNG**, alongside the **GSON** library. Test data was generated using **JavaFaker** and custom factories into reusable JSON files. Covered positive and negative scenarios by effectively managing request and response data with **POJOs** and **JsonPath**. Tests were well-organized by endpoints, utilizing helper classes.

* **SauceDemo Playwright Automation (WIP)** [[GitHub]](https://github.com/etoile-venus/Saucedemo-Playwright)
    * Currently a **Work In Progress (WIP)** UI automation project for SauceDemo, leveraging **Playwright** for modern web application testing.

* **Cypress Automation Exercises** [[GitHub]](https://github.com/etoile-venus/CypressPractice)
    * A collection of Cypress automation exercises written in pure **JavaScript**, exploring fundamental UI testing concepts on various demo web applications.
      
* **Bookstore CLI Application** [[GitHub]](https://github.com/etoile-venus/BookstoreApp)
    * Developed a pure **Java** application applying **OOP** principles, **CRUD** operations, and a **layered architecture** (CLI, Backend, Flat-file) for scalable design. Rigorously tested application functionality, including user login, role-based access, and all CRUD operations, to ensure data integrity and system reliability.
